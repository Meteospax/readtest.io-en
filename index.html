          <h3>Biggyerskur — childhood</h3>
          <p>
            Biggyerskur was born in an unmentioned, unknown, equally lost village with a local nickname as "sunset" - it's a small, ever so slightly cozy, closed off from the outside world settlement, only interesting due to the altar-statue of the essence of the god of death, an element of the history of their tribe and the whole race, standing against the new world in the form of a church of war. The name hides the same warm meaning, the newborn was named in honor of the village's agro-cultural trade and its god, hence the name as “bearing warmth” - as if praising the gift of food and warmth.  The village itself was located in the territories of the western Königtiglerund protectorate, next to other buffer principalities by those who constantly determine the geopolitical order - the eternal Mivoenlukdarr and Königtiglerund ambitions,  where the land of this village is the former history of the tribe, which was conquered long ago by the “Königt”, who appointed the god of war as the truth, integrating the god of death as one of the pillars of the argorian theology together with the people who worship him.
          </p>
          <p>
            His family was simple in its life, they were ordinary agrarian peasants without their own land for activities, living on the outskirts of their settlement with a small shack and a barn, however, they did not feel the limitations of space, it did not prevent the simple and poor family to breed, to have many children, in particular, to help with the household of the settlement, other things, as well as the hope that one of them will "get into the light" and so on: a child "bearing warmth" ended up in a family that was not warm and cozy at all. This family was extremely inferior, and even if it did not manifest itself on the born child, the "biggie" himself, moreover, from the moment of his birth, felt the pressures, stresses, echoes of screams and scandalous dialogues, full of disrespect, nastiness, hatred and projection of all this on his brothers and sisters, the localized family squabbles of his parents, their scandals - all this sowed discord in the child's mind, consciousness and of course feelings from the very beginning of his existence, for he was surrounded by excitement, anxiety, longing and futility of his very life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only known notable fact about his family, in a distant generation on his father's side - elven blood, on his mother's, even older - stone people-draconids, a certain subspecies of inhabitants of the far north with a touch of dragon genoseme, only this does not make them great, more like bastard scum; all sorts of genosemes in a simple random family hundreds - this one is no exception.
          </p>
          <p>
            Date of birth: 31/14/1503 according to the Königtiglerund calendar during the era of Itzkraeroberer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relatives, as such, by trauma and sorrow, or to be more precise, brothers and sisters, to the number of nine siblings and five sisters, from childhood had been saving and trying to isolate the youngest member of the family from the oppressive decay of existence in their so difficult life, in this respect, the whole tact of family life went around the newborn for the purpose of desire for his salvation.
